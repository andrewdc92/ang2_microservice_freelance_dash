# Manage your freelance proposals! 


You can draft up, organize, and email client proposals for freelance web design projects. 


To Use-

Clone the repo
- `cd` into `freelance-frontend`
-  Run `npm install`, ensure all modules were installed successfully (there are specified Angular 2 version dependencies as Angular 4 just rolled out when I was developing this)
- `npm start` -> should see the build compilation in the terminal

Open a new tab/window in your terminal, `cd` into `freelance_documents`
- Run `bundle install` to pull in gems
- Run `bundle exec rake db:setup` -> should see the database and migration initialized. Seed data included. 
- Run `rails s -p 3001`
- You should now have the Rails and Node servers running concurrently on port 3000 & 3001

Open a third tab in terminal, `cd` into `freelance_proposal`
- Run `bundle install` to pull in gems
- Run `bundle exec rake db:setup` -> should see the database and migration initialized. Seed data included. 
- Run `rails s -p 3002'`
- You should now have the Rails and Node servers running concurrently on port 3000, 3001, 3002
- Go to `localhost:3000/documents` to see the docs that are updated in real time from the database
- Draft up some proposals and build out your client pipeline!
